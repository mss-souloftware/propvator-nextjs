          Instant Funding Prop Firm - Accepted Trading Styles
        </h4>

        <h4 className="text-white text-xl my-5">Swing Trading</h4>
        <p className="text-white">
          Swing trading is encouraged during the challenge phases, allowing
          traders to take advantage of market fluctuations over several days.
          Traders can benefit from the longer holding periods associated with
          this style. However, once funded, you cannot hold trades over the
          weekend.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-xl my-5">Scalping</h4>
        <p className="text-white">
          Scalping is a highly active trading style allowed in Instant Funding's
          models. It involves making numerous trades throughout the day, aiming
          to profit from small price movements. Scalpers must stay alert and
          execute trades quickly to maximise profits. Instant Funding supports
          this strategy, providing traders with the opportunity to capitalise on
          market volatility with quick execution.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-xl my-5">
          Position Trading
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white">
          Position trading is another accepted style, focusing on long-term
          market trends. Traders can hold positions for weeks or even months,
          relying on fundamental analysis to guide their decisions. This style
          aligns well with traders looking to capture larger market moves
          without the need for constant monitoring.

          Prohibited Strategies
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white">
          While Instant Funding prop firm offers flexibility, there are specific
          strategies and practices that are strictly prohibited. Adhering to
          these rules is crucial for maintaining a funded account and avoiding
          penalties. We'll go over the prohibited strategies in this Instant
          Funding review.

          <li>
            <p className="text-white">
              Martingale: This strategy involves increasing the size of a
              position after a loss, leading to potential over-leverage and
              significant losses. For example, you have bought 2 lots of EURUSD
              and the trade is running in loss, if you open another EURUSD
              position with 4 lots (increasing the size of your position) this
              will constitute as martingale.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className="text-white">
              Grid Trading: This strategy involves placing multiple buy and sell
              orders at regular intervals, which can lead to increased risk
              exposure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p className="text-white">
              High-frequency Trading (HFT): Defined as holding trades for 5
              seconds or less, HFT is prohibited due to the risks associated
              with rapid trading. HFT is mostly done with EAs, and this is what
              most prop firms are against.

              Gambling: This refers to excessive leverage use, risking more than
              50% of your margin on a single trade. Such actions can result in

              Major News Trading: This involves trading within an 8-minute
              window before and after significant news events (4 minutes before
              and 4 minutes after). Profits made during this window may be
              deducted from your account, and in rare cases, the account may
              need to be reset. This rule affects only instruments related to
              the news event (e.g., EUR news doesn't restrict trading XAU/USD).

        <p className="text-white">Initial Drawdown</p>
        <p className="text-white">
          The initial drawdown starts at -10%.

          This development aims to streamline the funding process, making it
          easier for traders to deposit and withdraw funds swiftly. By using
          these widely accepted payment methods, traders can enjoy a more
          seamless financial experience, reducing the friction that often comes
          with traditional banking methods. This convenience not only saves time
          but also enhances overall user satisfaction.

          The trading education app is another significant product update that
          will be rolling out in 2024. This app will offer a wealth of
          resources, including tutorials, articles, and interactive courses
          designed to elevate traders’ skills. Importantly, it is expected that
          the app will address the critical aspect of trading psychology, which
          is often the missing piece for many traders. Understanding one’s
          emotional responses to market movements and developing a resilient
          mindset can make a substantial difference in trading success. By
          addressing this fundamental area, the app aims to empower traders to
          approach their trading strategies with confidence and clarity.
