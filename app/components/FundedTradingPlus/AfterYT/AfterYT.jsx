          Funded Trading Plus - Drawdown Method
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Funded Trading Plus employs a static drawdown calculation method,
          helping traders manage their risk effectively. All accounts have a
          Maximum Daily Drawdown of 5%, calculated at the end of each trading
          day.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-xl my-5">
          How is Maximum Daily Drawdown Calculated?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>
            Example 1: Equity is Higher than the Balance at the Start of the Day
          </b>
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          On day 5, if your account balance is $105,000 and your equity is
          $107,000, the Daily Loss Limit will be based on equity:
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Daily Loss = $107,000 * 5% = $5,350 Daily Loss Limit.</b>
          <br></br>
          This means your equity can't drop below $107,000 - $5,350, leading to
          a Daily Loss Limit of $101,650 on day 5. If your equity falls below
          this amount, your account will be closed.
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>
            Example 2: Balance is Higher than the Equity at the Start of the Day
          </b>
          <br></br>
          On day 7, if your account balance is $100,000 but your equity is only
          $99,000, the Daily Loss Limit is based on balance:
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Daily Loss = $100,000 * 5% = $5,000 Daily Loss Limit.</b>
          <br></br>
          Your equity can't drop below $100,000 - $5,000, resulting in a Daily
          Loss Limit of $95,000 on day 7. Falling below this limit will lead to
          account closure.
