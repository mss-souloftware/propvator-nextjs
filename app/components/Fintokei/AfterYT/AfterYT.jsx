          Fintokei Prop Firm - Drawdown Method
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          In Fintokei, managing drawdown and understanding the high-water mark
          are essential for staying within account limits. Exceeding these
          limits results in a hard breach, leading to the termination of your
          trading challenge or account.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Types of Drawdown: Daily and Overall</b>
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Fintokei measures drawdown through two main metrics: daily drawdown
          and overall drawdown. These calculations vary slightly between
          programs, depending on whether you’re using Starter Trader (3 Step) or
          Pro Trader (2 Step).
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Daily Drawdown:</b> Applicable only to Starter Trader, the daily
          drawdown is the maximum loss allowed in a single day, set at 5% of
          your account equity as of midnight server time. This limit
          recalculates nightly based on any gains or losses from the previous
          day. For instance, if you start with 100,000 EUR and gain 3,000 EUR,
          your new daily drawdown limit would be 97,850 EUR (5% below the new
          equity).
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Overall Drawdown</b>
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The overall drawdown applies to both Pro Trader and Starter Trader
          accounts and is set at 10% of your initial capital. For Pro Trader,
          this means if you start with 100,000 EUR, your equity must stay above
          90,000 EUR for the duration of the challenge.
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          In Starter Trader, however, overall drawdown is calculated based on
          the<b> High-Water Mark (HWM).</b> This metric tracks the highest
          equity your account achieves and recalibrates daily.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          For example, if your account reaches 10,500 EUR, the new drawdown
          limit is set at 9,450 EUR (10% below the HWM). The HWM never decreases
          unless you make a withdrawal, which adjusts the HWM to reflect the new
          balance.
