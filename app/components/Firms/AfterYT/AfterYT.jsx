          Fxify Prop Firm - Information & Discount Code
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Fxify prop firm was established in April 2023 in the United Kingdom.
          It has quickly gained attention in the prop firm industry due to its
          flexibility. One key aspect that sets Fxify prop firm apart is the
          ability to add custom features. Custom features include raw spreads
          and commission-free accounts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          You can also benefit from bi-weekly payouts instead of the standard
          monthly payouts for an additional 5% fee. If you’re aiming for a
          higher profit margin, you can opt to increase your profit split from
          80% to 90% for an extra 20% of your challenge price.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Additionally, traders looking for increased leverage on forex and gold
          can upgrade to leverage of 1:50. This is an increase from the standard
          1:30, for an additional 25% cost. These add-ons are designed to help
          traders maximise their potential earnings and streamline their trading
          based on their preferences.

          this feedback for improvement is a positive indicator of the firm's
          direction.

          Fxify Prop Firm - Drawdown Method{" "}
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          In prop trading, understanding the different types of drawdown is
          crucial. Balance-based drawdown is calculated based on the overall
          balance of your account, while equity-based drawdown considers the
          current equity value.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The Fxify prop firm employs distinct drawdown calculation methods for
          the 1 Step account compared to the 2 Step and 3 Step accounts. This
          means there’s one rule for the 1 Step account and a different rule for
          the 2 Step and 3 Step accounts.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">
          Fxify 1 Step Account Drawdown Calculation
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          For the Fxify 1 Step Account, the Maximum Trailing Drawdown is the
          highest amount your account can lose before reaching a hard breach.
          When you start, your Max Trailing Drawdown is set at 6% of your
          initial balance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          This amount will trail your High Water Mark until your profits reach
          6%. Once you hit that profit level, the maximum trailing drawdown
          locks in at your starting balance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">Here’s how it works in simple terms:</p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Example 1:</b> Starting with a $100,000 account, your max loss is
          6% ($6,000). Therefore, your account must not drop below $94,000.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Example 2:</b>
          If your account balance rises to $105,000, your max drawdown becomes
          $99,000 ($105,000 - $6,000). Your balance should not fall below this
          amount.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Example 3:</b>
          If your balance goes above $106,000, your max trailing drawdown locks
          in at $100,000, meaning your account can never drop below this level.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Example 4:</b>
          If you reach $110,000, your max trailing drawdown remains at $100,000,
          allowing for a 10% overall drawdown.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>Example 5:</b>
          If you hit $106,000 and then your account drops to $102,000, the max
          trailing drawdown is still set at $100,000.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">
          Fxify 2 Step and 3 Step Account Drawdown Calculation
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          For the Fxify 2 Step and 3 Step Accounts, the drawdown rules are
          different. The maximum drawdown is the highest your account can
          decline before a hard breach occurs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          When you start these accounts, the max drawdown is set at 10% of your
          starting balance for the 2 Step Account and 5% for the 3 Step Account.
          This drawdown percentage remains static throughout the life of the
          account.

          Scaling with Fxify Prop Firm
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Scaling is a vital aspect of trading, as it allows you to continuously
          improve and grow your trading account. The more you can get funded
          with each prop firm, the better your chances of maximising your gains.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          With the Fxify scaling plan, you have an opportunity to increase your
          account size significantly, enabling you to leverage your skills for
          greater profit potential.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">
          How Does Your Scaling Plan Work?
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The Fxify scaling plan works on a straightforward yet effective model.
          To scale up your account by 25%, you must achieve a 10% return in the
          first three months, with at least two out of those three months being
          profitable. Once you hit these targets, subsequent scaling occurs
          every three months, provided you maintain the same performance
          metrics. Each successful scale-up effectively doubles your account
          balance.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Here’s a breakdown of how the scaling works:
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>After the first three months:</b>If you start with a $400,000
          account and meet the scaling criteria, your account balance will
          increase by 25%, bringing it to $500,000.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>After six months:</b>
          Continuing to meet the profit targets, your account size will double
          to $1,000,000.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>After nine months:</b>
          Following the same pattern, your balance will reach $2,000,000.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          <b>After twelve months: </b>
          If you keep hitting your targets, your account size will double again,
          culminating in a massive $4,000,000 account.
        </p>
        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">
          Fxify Prop Firm - Profit Split
        </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          At Fxify Prop Firm, traders benefit from an attractive profit split
          structure. The profit split starts at 80%, allowing you to keep a
          substantial portion of your earnings. For traders looking to maximise
          their profits, there's an option to increase the profit split to 90%.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          This 90% profit split add-on is available for an additional cost,
          specifically 20% of your challenge price. For example, if the cost of
          your account is $100, opting for the 90% profit split would mean you
          pay $120. This investment can be worthwhile for traders who are
          confident in their strategies and wish to retain a higher percentage
          of their profits.

          option to increase to 1:50 through additional add-ons for an extra
          25%. The initial leverage of 1:30 is generally adequate for most
          traders, as it aligns with the standards set by FCA-regulated brokers,
          which typically offer a maximum leverage of 1:30 to help mitigate risk
          for retail traders.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          This slightly reduced leverage could actually benefit you by lowering
          potential risks. However, should you find the need for more leverage,
          you have the flexibility to increase it. For other assets, the
          leverage differs: it is set at 1:10 for indices and 1:2 for stocks and
          cryptocurrencies.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Fxify Review - Commissions</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Fxify charges a commission of $6 per round lot, meaning you’ll incur
          $3 when entering a position and another $3 upon exiting. While some
          brokers may deduct this fee all at once, Fxify ensures that your total
          commission does not exceed $6 per round lot.
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          If you prefer to trade without incurring commissions, you can opt for
          an add-on that sets your commission to $0. This flexibility makes
          Fxify an appealing choice for traders looking to tailor their accounts
          to fit their trading strategies.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Fxify Review - Dashboard</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Let’s explore the Fxify dashboard to get a quick overview of what’s
          available for traders. Below, we will walk through the various
          sections and tools. Please note that this example shows a dashboard
          with no active challenges. Once you purchase a challenge, additional
          tools and features will become available.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Dashboard</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The first section you’ll see is the Dashboard. This is where you’ll
          find a variety of options, including social media links to the Fxify
          Discord community and YouTube channel. You can also purchase
          challenges, complete your KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, join
          trading competitions, and refer friends to the platform. If you have
          any active challenges, they will be displayed here, along with the
          Leaderboard, which ranks traders by performance. The dashboard is the
          largest section on the platform, combining several key areas for easy
          access.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Trading Accounts</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          In the Trading Accounts section, you can manage all your challenges.
          This includes active, failed, archived, or visible challenges. This
          section provides an organized view of your accounts
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Contract</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          If you have successfully passed a challenge and signed a contract to
          get funded, this section stores your contract for easy reference. You
          can review it at any time.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Competitions</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The Competitions section displays all upcoming and active trading
          competitions. You can view details such as the competition rules,
          dates, and prize pool to help you decide whether to join. You’ll also
          find a live tracker of participants and their progress, as well as a
          review of past competitions, showing results, rankings, and winners.
        </p>

        <Image

          alt="Instant Funding"
        />

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Leaderboard</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The Leaderboard is one of the most popular and exciting tools
          available on the Fxify dashboard. It shows the top traders in
          real-time, with rankings based on percentage return rather than the
          total profit in dollar amount. This system ensures that traders are
          competing based on their skills and performance, regardless of their
          account size.
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          In addition to percentage returns, the leaderboard also displays the
          dollar amount of profit each trader has earned and their country of
          origin. It's a great feature to check out when you’re looking for
          inspiration and want to see what’s possible with prop trading on
          Fxify!

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Certificates </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The Certificates section is where all of your achievements with Fxify
          are stored. Once you pass challenges, get funded, receive payouts, or
          achieve maximum allocation, you’ll be awarded certificates that you
          can share on your social media profiles. These certificates serve as
          recognition of your milestones and are automatically generated as you
          progress. It’s a great way to showcase your success and inspire others
          in the trading community!

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Billing </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The Billing section provides a complete overview of your purchases
          with Fxify. You can easily access details about your transactions,
          including the date, order number, challenge size and type, any add-ons
          selected, and a downloadable invoice for your records. This section
          ensures that all your purchases are well-documented and easily
          accessible whenever you need to reference them.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Offers </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          The Offers section is a unique feature of Fxify, setting it apart from
          many other prop firms. Here, traders can access exclusive discounts on
          various trading tools and products, such as Magic Keys, TradingView,
          and other useful software.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Economic Calendar</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          While many traders often use external economic calendars from
          platforms like ForexFactory or TradingView, Fxify has streamlined the
          process by integrating an economic calendar directly into their
          dashboard. This feature ensures that traders don't need to switch
          between tabs while trading with Fxify. Powered by TradingView, the
          calendar remains up-to-date and reliable, providing real-time updates
          on key economic events to help you make informed trading decisions.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Analyst Views</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          This is an exciting tool and something you may find very helpful. It
          shows analysis across almost all asset types: forex, cryptocurrencies,
          stocks, indices, and commodities. The analysis is based on senior
          analysts' insights combined with sophisticated algorithms. This
          feature helps you validate your own trading ideas, adding an extra
          layer of confluence, which can boost your confidence and enhance your
          trading strategy.

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Featured Ideas</h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          This section operates similarly to trading signals, providing clear
          indicators on whether an asset is bullish or bearish. Alongside the
          direction of the market, you’ll get a brief analysis outlining the
          reasoning behind the projection. To make it even clearer, you’ll find
          chart analysis included, giving you a visual reference for the trading
          idea or signal presented.
        </p>

        <h4 className="text-white text-3xl my-5">Overview </h4>
        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          Beyond the main tools, the dashboard includes quick links to essential
          areas such as your profile, customer support, affiliate portal,
          Discord community, and a logout button. These links make it easy to
          navigate to important sections without leaving the dashboard.
        </p>

        <p className="text-white mb-3">
          For traders working with multiple prop firms or even just one, joining
          their Discord community is an excellent way to connect with other
          traders, share ideas, and gain insights.

          Trustpilot, with most traders expressing satisfaction and giving
